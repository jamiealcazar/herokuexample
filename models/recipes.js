    name: 'Puffball',
    recipe: 'Puffballs are an excellent source of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and micronutrients. Because they tend to grow quite large, this species of mushroom can be made into a healthy pizza crust when sliced into thin discs. Many foragers also enjoy breading them in seasoned panko and deep/air frying for a crunchy snack or appetizer. You might also enjoy cubing them up and substituting them for popular recipes that call for meat or tofu.',

    name: 'Chicken of the Woods',
    recipe: 'This species does not only get its name from its vibrant rooster-like coloration, but its meaty chicken flavor as well so the possibilities are endless! For starters, a plant-based twist on everyone\'s favorite fried chicken or a fried chicken sandwich. You can also opt to saut√®e this with onions, spinach, garlic, and heavy cream for a delicious pair to pasta. Gameday? Fry these up, toss in buffalo sauce, and get that blue cheese dip out for a starter that\'ll have everyone talking at the tailgate!',

    name: 'Oyster',
    recipe: 'Oysters are a humble species with lots of great meaty texture. Many foragers enjoy these sauteed in a simple brown butter and sage sauce but any flavor combo would work amazingly. Use it as a pizza topping in lieu of or with other meat, throw into a pasta, or enjoy with teriyaki sauce with green onions over rice for a healthier chicken teriyaki alternative. Don\'t be afraid to bust these out on Taco Tuesday either...in a warm tortilla with tons of cilantro and salsa, your friends and family will never know the difference!',

    name: 'Chanterelle',
    recipe: 'Getting fancy with a Chanterelle doesn\'t have to break the bank if you\'re foraging! This buttery delicacy is stunning on toast topped with herbs, in a parpadelle cream sauce, or as the seasons start to change, a heartwarming autumnal soup. May we suggest butternut squash? Or even better in a wild mushroom soup blend? Go crazy with this luxe find!',

    name: 'Morel',
    recipe: 'So you\'ve stumbled upon the sought-after morel. Go ahead and call yourself a pro-forager because you\'re practically royalty now. At high-end restaurants, these fanciful mushrooms tend to be paired with crab, steak, or just as rare finds such as truffle but the humble forager may choose to add this as a complement to chicken dishes, pastas, stuffed with cheese, or the star ingredient in a bisque.',

    name: 'Woodear',
    recipe: 'In many traditional Chinese recipes, this floppy mushroom is tossed cold in salads, stir fried with green beans and tofu, or eaten with lotus root but these would also be delicious with meat such as chicken or pork. The best complement to this black fungus is rice or a noodle of some sort but we\'re all (wood)ears for whatever creative decision a forager might come up with when cooking with this shroom!',

  {
    name: 'Porcini',
    recipe: 'Porcinis are rich and flavorful with a chewy texture which make them a popular mushroom in many Italian dishes. Because they already have so much umami flavor on their own, you can enjoy this to elevate cream sauces for pastas or meat or in a rich soup. These are also delicious stewed for an exciting appetizer or the star ingredient in a creamy risotto with nutty Parmesan.',

    name: 'Enokitake/Enoki',
    recipe:'The versatile enokitake can be used to complement flavorful broth soups such as that of udon or ramen as well as the main component of any great appetizer. You might enjoy these bundled in bacon or beef and sauteed, drenched in cornstarch and deep fried to a fun fan shape, or simply stir fried with other vegetables. But let it be known that these aren\'t called See You Tomorrow mushrooms for no reason...just don\'t say we didn\'t warn you.',

    name:'Lion\'s Mane',
    recipe:'Lion\'s Mane mushrooms are known for their delicious seafood-esque flavor (particularly its similarity to crab and lobster) so these would be great alternatives in any seafood dish (does this make the Lion\'s Mane King of the...Ocean??). Some notable recipes include faux crab cakes with panko breadcrumbs, Old Bay, dijon mustard, and worcestershire sauce. However, it can also be steeped as a tea chock full of nutritional benefits.',

    name:'Shiitake',
    recipe:'The Shiitake is a personal favorite of mine. It has a naturally rich, sweet, umami flavor on its own that I enjoy sauteeing with green onions and eating over rice but I also love it in in bowls of ramen and stir fried with other vegetables like bok choy in Oyster sauce. These are also very popular in its dehydrated form to snack on for a healthful snacking choice. Sprinkle on some toasted sesame seeds and enjoy this delicious shroom!',

    name:'King Trumpet',
    recipe:'The King Trumpet is another mushroom popularly used in plant-based recipes that call for faux scallops! When the stems of this mushroom are cut into discs of medium-thickness and scored on top, they look strinkingly similar to the mollusk so you can enjoy a delicious buttery sage "scallop" dish without breaking the bank! If you like more savory, thick-sauced dishes, cutting into these vertically and putting through a skewer makes for a great faux bbq chicken!',
