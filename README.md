In addition to their high nutritional value and commonplace usage in many loved cuisines around the world, mushrooms are more than just a fun guy (haha..). They are revered in many spiritual and medicinal contexts as well as the center of research by many scientists studying life and death cycles.

Today, modernized societies have advanced beyond our needs that we do not need to solely rely on hunting and gathering in order to sustain ourselves. However, the art of foraging is still a hobby and a way of life for many people around the world.

Oh My Mycophile is a website designed to support the amateur mushroom forager by providing resources for safe mushroom foraging practices, common forageable mushrooms you can find in the wild, recipe suggestions for those different forageable mushrooms, and the historical contexts of mushrooms in food and ancient/modern day medicine.
